### Hi, I'm Nate.
After a decade of residential construction, carpentry and woodworking I am shifting my focus to the field of data science and am
learning how to view the world through the lens of empirical data. I love the idea of being able to parse the validity of an argument or an idea 
using objective techniques. Uncovering my own hidden biases or accidentally disproving my own theories while in search of truth
seems like time well spent. While tools like statistical models and machine learning are not crystal balls that cast an unavoidable vision of the future,
they do allow us to better identify patterns hidden in plain sight, and can add a profoundly beneficial layer of context to many decision making
processes.\

This GitHub account is where I am posting my progress and growth as I discover and explore the concepts of statistical analysis, computer science, probability,
data visualization and the slew of other elements the make up the art of Data Science.
